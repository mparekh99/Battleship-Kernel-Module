Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] F1 - mihir_parekh

Completed: 65%

TimeSpent: 3 Days

Approach: Used the lecture tictactoe, google, matrix, chatgpt

Problems:
To start I was stuck trying to understand how to write and
read for the longest time. Didn't realize that they are an
illusion. And understanding the mutex was a big learning
curve for me for some reason. I definetly have many memory
leaks but I tried to maintain thread saftey. I ended up coding
read, ioctl, and write. My read was very close to being
completed, however I ran into issues with snprintf trying
to convert integer coordinates into strings to store
into buf and pass it to the user via copy_to_user. Overall
I really struggled with this project and had to present
today as well. I hope I can get as much credit as possible
I saw there is another Pacth needed where I add 5 tests,
however I spent time correcting the tests I got sent and
have worked on this for way too long.

V2: In this version I actually have an attempt.
Although some of the code is commented out, I
tried writting comments in case you needed to
see. When you sudo dmesg it prints the gameboard.
With the randomized ships being placed and writing
seems to work as well. Read is the furtherst I
got, but the logic seems sound.
